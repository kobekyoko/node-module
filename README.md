## FS (file system) module

I practiced 5 fs methods to understand how to use file system module

readfile -asynchronous (call back function)

readfileSync -synchronous. If you run readfile and readfileSync at the same time, readfileSync comes first beacause it is synchronous.

appendFile -add the texts etc. to the file you like

writeFile -create (add) a new file

unlink -delete a file
